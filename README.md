## Features
- Computation runs entirely on the GPU in parallel using WebGPU compute shaders.
- Supports up to 800k graviational bodies interacting in real-time.
- Linear bounding-volume hierarchy (LBVH) to accelerate runtime from O(n^2) to O(nlogn) using the Barnes-Hut algorithm.
- Tone-mapping shader to aesthetically represent density without over-exposure.
- Easy pan and zoom interactions.
- Ability to select number of bodies and scenario (more to come soon?).
